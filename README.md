An assembly program for the PIC18F87K22 which drives two servo motors.
Servo motors are driven using PWM signals.
Inputs taken from a keypad for both angle inputs or incremental changes.

interrupts.asm is a relic from older versions. Could not be removed due to new version of MPLAB not accepting older file versions.
